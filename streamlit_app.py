# Welcome to Streamlit!

Edit `/streamlit_app.py` to customize this app to your heart's desire :heart:

If you have any questions, checkout our [documentation](https://docs.streamlit.io) and [community
forums](https://discuss.streamlit.io).

In the meantime, below is an example of what you can do with just a few lines of code:

# My first app
Here's our first attempt at using data to create a table:
"""

df = pd.DataFrame({
  'first column': [1, 2, 3, 4],
  'second column': [10, 20, 30, 40]
})

st.write(df)


x = st.slider('x')

st.write(x, 'squared is', x * x)
st.text_input("Your name", key="name")
st.session_state.name
